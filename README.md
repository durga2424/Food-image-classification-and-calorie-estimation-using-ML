# Food-image-classification-and-calorie-estimation-using-ML
The project can be broadly divided into
  1.Search the appropriate dataset from the internet (many are available)
  2.Choose the appropriate ML algorithm/model to do classification and then predict the calorie estimation
  3.Building and evaluating your machine learning models
  4.If possible build an app to make it work in realtime
